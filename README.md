# Recursive-Decent-Parser
My meek foray into lexical (not) freedom and simple grammar parsers. Tentatively thought of as M'Lexer as an ode to M'Lady from being developed on Fedora. Also, M'lady always reminds me of "Malady" - which of course both a lady and writing a parser are 
likely to give you, in the vaguest of senses. A remarkable coincidence, really.

### ToDo
