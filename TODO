1. Add command line argument. Probably just load argv[] into a string stream and then pass that. ezpz.
2. expand to powers and factorials.
3. add trig functions -- this will take a lot of work and possibly an entirely new parser
	(but that's half the fun, istn it?)
4. Turn this biotch into a hooker. And by hooker, I mean let this program hook into other programs.
	(IDEA -- binary addition on an arduino/rpi would be a ton of fun)
	with a serial transmit, I could actually make switches to add this shit.
5. ...TBD
6. ???
7. Profit.

And a lot more.
